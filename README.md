# Course project 1 - Tropical-Paradise
This is a page I did during one of the school's "mmcschool.pl" courses. The idea and choice of techniques are the intellectual property of the author of the course. 

During this course I learned: 
- build a responsive website based on flexbox 
- implement animation on the page 
- use ready-made components in SAAS 
- use external libraries like slick.js
- new ways to expose content on a website
- use git commands ;)
